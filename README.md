Vivisection is a fullstack application that utilizes geolocation. The purpose of the app is to allow locals to document local histories and showcase them in an engaging way. The app encourages users to explore their community and learn more about what has happened in it. Inspired by the rise in gentrification in Boston and the need to preserve the voices of marginalized communities.

## How its Made
The application is built using Node.Js, Express, MongoDB, JSON, XML, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Mapbox API.


## Reflections
Tackling the Map Box API was definitely one of the most interesting parts of this project, since I had to adapt much of its Javascript code (used to create certain elements) to my own application which created new listed items using EJS. It was a puzzle figuring out how to fetch information from my database and render it on the /maps page. MapBox had intended users of their API to hard code information to be rendered. Solving this puzzle was definitely the most gratifying part of the project.
