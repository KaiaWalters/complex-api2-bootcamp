The Foodist is a static webpage that I based off of The Foodist website.

## How its Made
This project involved the use of HTML and CSS. I made great use of floats when positioning elements on this page. In order to emulate The Foodist's website to the T I made use of a color picker. Images where borrowed from google (with usage rights in mind).


## What I Learned
When tackling this project, the greatest challenge was using floats to position the next buttons at the bottom of the paragraph section. Many of the sectuons in this project were virtually invisible, but made up the stylish grey lines and borders that gave the site its asthetic. So while constructing my layout I have to admit I made a few mistakes. Luckily I was able to bounce back quickly repositioning my sections to get everything where it was suposed to be.
