Vivisection is complex API application. It sources its data from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium and Webster Dictionary's API. The app fetches details on a mouse: age, sex,the procedure that was performed on the mouse, and the allele that was being targeted in the experiment. The procedure is defined by the Webster API and it definition is displayed on screen. The inspiration for the project came from my time spent in Bio labs in college where we wouls analyse the genes and mutated alleles of flies. When I saw the mouse API I thought it would be useful to see the correlation between the allele being targeted and the procedure being performed on a mouse. And I thought, "Why not have an app that defines these procedures for you rather than flipping thorugh a dictionary"?

## How its Made
The application is built using JSON, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webster Dictionary API, and IMPC API.


## Reflections
This was one of my first projects that utilized APIs and fetxhes, learning how to cycle though JSON objects sent from the database was definitely a learning experience but it was great to see how my understanding of Javascript and loops especially was applicable here.
